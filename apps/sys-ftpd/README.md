# sys-ftpd

This is a nintendo-switch sysmodule which runs an ftpd-server in the background (on port 5000 with no auth).

The ftpd is basically copy paste from [this](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/ftpd) ftpd-fork.

Put the contents of the sd_card folder in the root of your sd-card or else the sound effects won't work!
